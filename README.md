# hostel-management
The basic purpose of designing this system is to avoid the paper work involved in the alloaction of hostel rooms to students
. Managers will be appointed to different hostels and all the details of students 
will be stored in database using MYSQL and php. Admin will be in charge of this whole system.

This hostel management system can be further extended for use in hospitals and private hostels.
